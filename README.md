# CISB62_Final_Project

An autoencoder is a type of neural network architecture with two components. The first part is an encoder that accepts input data and reduces the number of dimensions by learning the most critical features. The second part is the decoder that accepts the lower-dimension data and reconstructs the original data.

This project uses an autoencoder to convert grayscale images to color images. A public data set containing pairs of grayscale images and matching color images is used for training. The autoencoder will accept the grayscale images as input and try create an output that closely matches the corresponding color images. A loss function is used to measure the difference between the generated color image and the actual color image in the data set.
